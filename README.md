Quick adjustments to try out using the latest claude 3.5 model with the existing LLM chat app. Provide your own API key either direct in the code, or in the ENV file

Although this demo is developed using flutter, only the complete code of the iOS side has been completed. You can download and run it. The Android side is under development and adaptation, so stay tuned.

You can use visual studio or xcode to run the demo directly currently. It needs to be run on a real device.
